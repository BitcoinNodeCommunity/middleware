# middleware

Middleware wraps [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)'s gRPC API, and exposes them via a RESTful API.

It is part of Citadel's effort to create an open source, easy to use, and secure Bitcoin full node.

## üöÄ Getting started

Middleware is normally part of Citadel, but you can also run it manually.

## üõ† Running middleware

Make sure a [`bitcoind`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [`lnd`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) instance is running and available on the same machine.

### Step 1. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

### Step 2. Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables directly or by placing them in `.env` file of project's root.

| Variable              | Description                                                                                           | Default                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                | Port where middleware should listen for requests                                                      | `3005`                             |

| `BITCOIN_HOST`        | IP or domain where `bitcoind` RPC is listening                                                        | `127.0.0.1`                        |
| `RPC_USER`            | `bitcoind` RPC username                                                                               |                                    |
| `RPC_PASSWORD`        | `bitcoind` RPC password                                                                               |                                    |
| `LND_HOST`            | IP or domain where `lnd` RPC is listening                                                             | `127.0.0.1`                        |
| `TLS_FILE`            | Path to `lnd`'s TLS certificate                                                                       | `/lnd/tls.cert`                    |
| `LND_PORT`            | Port where `lnd` RPC is listening                                                                     | `10009`                            |
| `LND_NETWORK`         | The chain `bitcoind` is running on (mainnet, testnet, regtest, simnet)                                | `mainnet`                          |
| `MACAROON_DIR`        | Path to `lnd`'s macaroon directory                                                                    | `/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/` |
| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` | Path to the JWT public key created by [`manager`](https://github.com/runcitadel/manager) | `/jwt-public-key/jwt.pem`          |

### Step 3. Run middleware

yarn start
```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Citadel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really _#reckless_.
